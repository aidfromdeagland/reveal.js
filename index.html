						WHAT IS IT? →→→
						In business AGILITY is the ability to create and respond to change.
						It's a way of dealing with an uncertain environment.
						Software development – is an extra competitive area,
						where the speed of implementation of ideas and meeting client’s expectations are critical.
						And AGILE provides both: low Time To Market and client orientation.
						That’s why AGILE is so popular. As popular as some kind of … RELIGION.
						By the way AGILE really looks like a religion: →→→

						So, it is Manifesto for AGILE Software Development where 4 essential values of AGILE are declared. →→→

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Core values</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><b  style="color: deepskyblue">Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools</li>
						<li class="fragment"><b  style="color: deepskyblue">Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation</li>
						<li class="fragment"><b  style="color: deepskyblue">Customer collaboration</b> over contract negotiation</li>
						<li class="fragment"><b  style="color: deepskyblue">Responding to change over</b> following a plan</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						And these values say, that:  →→→
						<br>
						• The focus should be more on individuals and interactions instead of processes and tools. →→→
						<br>
						• Working software is more important than comprehensive documentation →→→
						<br>
						• Customer collaboration is more vital than contract negotiation →→→
						<br>
						• The process should respond to change rather than follow a plan
						<br>
						I think, nothing of this requires my explanation.
						One thing, I want to point out - these statements are not about one item exclude or substitute another.
						No, it's about priority. For example, actual and detailed documentation -
						is a great thing, that helps during the development process, post-release support,
						refactoring, and so on. But when we choose, what to do first: usable product or perfect documentation,
						we prefer the product. →→→
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Main principles</h2>
					<ul class="fragment" style="font-size: 22px;">
						<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
						<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. AGILE processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. </li>
						<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. </li>
						<li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. </li>
						<li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. </li>
						<li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. </li>
						<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
						<li>AGILE processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. </li>
						<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
						<li>Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential. </li>
						<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. </li>
						<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. </li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						In addition to the values we have twelve principles of AGILE. →→→
						Each of them is important and all of them together are about communication, collaboration,
						high-qualified and cross-functional team, personal responsibility and reacting to changing environment. →→→

						<aside class="notes">
							Organizational structure: iterative and linear
							<br>
							<p>An iteration, in the context of an AGILE project, is a timebox during which development takes place.
							Usually an iteration takes from 1 to 4 weeks. An iteration is a kind of full-cycle mini-project,
								that includes all stages of development process with some part of functionality: from planing and design to testing and delivery.
								When an iteration ends, a new iterations begins with a new part of the functionality to implement and all process repeats.
								If some tasks were failed, they moved to the next iteration.
								<br>
								In WATERFALL model we have a linear structure, where every next step starts only when previous was fully completed.
								There are no iterations or partial implementations and our client gets his product at the very end. ↓

					<section data-background-image="src/img/agile-waterfall-expectation.png" data-background-size="contain">
						<aside class="notes">
							User requirements and involvement of clients
							<br>
							Permanent input of user requirements with frequent delivery of the product in AGILE
							provides a high level of client involvement and makes connections between clients and developers closer.
							<br>
							When in WATERFALL model the main source of client’s requirements –
							is requirements specification as an appendix to the contract.
							And if this specification is not detailed enough, the final product may not meet client's expectations ↓

					<section data-background-image="src/img/informal-formal.png" data-background-size="contain">
						<aside class="notes">
							model preference and business processes
							<br>
							Taking into account high uncertainty, AGILE can't set strict processes and rules,
							because new requirements may need new processes and new models of interaction.
							Adaption becomes a key feature of business processes
							<br>
							In WATERFALL model, business processes are more formal and more bureaucracy takes place. ↓

					<section data-background-image="src/img/estimation.png" data-background-size="contain">

							effort estimation
							<br>
							Because of the high qualification and experience of AGILE team,
							they make effort estimation by themselves. Effort estimation takes place at the beginning of each iteration
							and usually measured in so-called story points.
							<br>
							In WATERFALL the only person, who provides estimates is Project Manager. Efforts are estimated in hours ↓
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="src/img/reviews.png" data-background-size="contain">
						<aside class="notes">
							Finally, the last point - reviews.
							In AGILE reviews take place at the end of each iteration, when team members discuss what was good, what was bad,
							what kind of changes they need to implement in processes, etc…
							The team interested in this kind of review because it helps to make interactions better and whole job more comfortable.
							<br>
							Reviews in terms of WATERFALL model may take features of routine reporting for the customer. →→→

							<aside class="notes">
								FLEXIBILITY
								<br>
								When it comes to making changes in the product or a process, AGILE is much more flexible than WATERFALL.
								AGILE focuses on the product and if our customer needs changes,
								we have no problem to tune all processes or change the product to meet updated requirements. ↓

						<section data-background-image="src/img/transparency.jpg" data-background-size="contain">

								TRANSPARENCY
								<br>
								AGILE keeps processes transparent. The clients, team members, and management
								are actively involved during the development lifecycle.
								All team members see the progress right from the start to the end.
								Everyone knows what another does. All is clear and transparent. It makes interactions more effective. ↓

								OWNERSHIP AND ACCOUNTABILITY
								<br>
								In the AGILE methodology, every team member shares ownership of the project.
								Each one of them plays an active role to complete the iteration within the estimated time.
								High personal responsibility ensures more quality products. ↓
